### Create Room

You can create your room with the `@dig` command, for example typing `@dig
bunker` would create a room called bunker.

```
> @dig bunker
bunker (#156) created.
```

Your room will have a number, that looks something like `#156`

You can go to your room with the `@go` command, For example `@go #156` would
take you to room #156, the bunker from our example

Now you can describe your room with the `@describe` command

```
> @describe #156 as "pretty cozy for a bunker"
Description set.
```

If you forget what number your room is, you can use the `@audit` command to
list your objects, including your rooms.
