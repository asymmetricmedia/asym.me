#### Getting Started
You interact with the Assembly by ***typing commands***

The ***examples below*** use the player name `quirk` and the password
`p@ssw@rd`. Use the player name you want to create, or to connect to instead,
and choose a good password

#### Creating an account
```
create quirk p@ssw@rd
```

#### Connect to existing account
```
connect quirk p@ssw@rd
```

#### Speaking with others
Once you have connected you can talk with the say command:
```
say Greetings Comrades!
```

You can also use `whisper` to talk to just one person

```
whisper "make me a programmer?" to quirk
```
