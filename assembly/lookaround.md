#### Look around

The `look` command by itself tells you abut the room your are in, you can look
at something or someone by using `look` with the name of what you want to look
at, for example `look quirk` would look at a player called quirk.

You can see who is online with the `@who` command, that will list the name and
location of currently connected players

When the room you are in has exists, they will be described when you `look`,
then you can just `go` there. `go` (without the '@') makes you go the room the
exit leads to. You can teleport to any room you are allowed to go to with the
`@go` command (note the "@") using the room's number, for example `@go #156`
