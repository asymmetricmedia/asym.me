The Telekommunisten Assembly is an interactive, multi-user, text-based social
platform built with MOO software originally developed in 1990.

The Assembly is extensible and user programmable by users, you can explore and
chat with others, but also build your own objects and areas.

The best way to learn how to participate in the Assembly is to connect and chat
with us there and also type `help` a lot. You can get help for specific topics
and commands, like `help players` to learn how to describe yourself, set your
gender, etc.
