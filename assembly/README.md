The Telekommunisten Assembly is a is an interactive, multi-user text-based
social platform built with MOO software originally developed in 1990.

The Assembly is extensible and user programmable by users, you can explore and
chat with others, but also build your own objects and areas.

Best way to learn how to participate in the Assembly is to type `help`.
You can also get help for specific commands, like `help players` to learn how
to describe yourself, set your gender, etc.
